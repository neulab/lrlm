## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 0.4+
- Other packages:
    - IPython
    - tqdm
    - tensorboardX
    - [fastText@bc12859](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/tree/bc1285939f1c216bd358425c3685a049dd8f56c0)
    - mypy-extensions


## Usage

1. Clone this repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neulab/lrlm.git
   cd lrlm
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   To prevent incorrect or conflicting package versions, it is recommended to install dependencies in a virtual
   environment.
   
2. Download required files, including the dataset, unknown word probabilities, and (for inference only) pre-trained
   model weights:
   ```bash
   # Wikitext-S,F dataset
   wget https://github.com/neulab/lrlm/releases/download/v1.0/wikitext.tar.bz2

   # Wikifacts dataset
   wget https://github.com/neulab/lrlm/releases/download/v1.0/wikifacts.tar.bz2
   
   # Transformer-XL on WikiText-F model weights
   wget https://github.com/neulab/lrlm/releases/download/v1.0/t-xl_wt-f_model17.pt

   # Transformer-XL on WikiText-S model weights
   wget https://github.com/neulab/lrlm/releases/download/v1.0/t-xl_wt-s_model12.pt
   ```
   Note that the list of resources above are available under [releases](https://github.com/neulab/lrlm/releases).

   Please contact us for pretrained models for different configurations.

   FastText model weights can be downloaded via [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zBBMnhYEMWXAS0QK3Wg2q_fENcKLAXTE/view?usp=sharing).
   
3. To train a new model, use one of the scripts in the `scripts/` directory, e.g.
   `scripts/train_lrlm_transformer_wikitext_short.sh`. This will create a directory for the experiment named
   `lrlm-transformer-wikitext-short` under the working directory, containing the following files:

   - `model<k>.pt`: The model checkpoint at the k-th epoch. Checkpoints are only saved when the validation results for
     that epoch improves over previous epochs.
   - `<timestamp>.txt`: The training log file.
   - `<script>.sh`: A copy of the script used to run the experiment.

   Some additional command line flags that might be useful:

   - `--exp-suffix`: Add a suffix to the name of the experiment directory.
   - `--overwrite`: Use this flag to overwrite the experiment directory. If this flag is not specified, training will
     not proceed if the experiment directory exists.
   - `--no-cuda`: The scripts enable CUDA by default. Use this flag to run on devices without GPU.
   - `--debug`: Run without saving files or writing to Tensorboard.
   - `--pdb`: Invoke the Python debugger (pdb) when an uncaught exception is encountered.
   - `--no-cache-dataset`: Do not load cached versions of the dataset. By default the processed dataset will be cached
     under the dataset path, and future runs with the same dataset configurations will be able to use the cached
     version.

4. To evaluate a trained model, use the same script for training, with the additional flags:

   - `--mode eval`: Use evaluation mode.
   - `--pretrained /path/to/experiment/dir`: Load pre-trained models from the given experiment directory. The best model
     under the directory will be loaded. You can also use a path to a specific checkpoint to load that checkpoint.

   ```bash
   ./scripts/train_lrlm_transformer_wikitext_short.sh \
       --mode eval \
       --pretrained lrlm-transformer-wikitext-short/
   ```

5. To perform inference on a trained model, use the same script for training, with the additional flags:

   - `--pretrained /path/to/experiment/dir`: Load pre-trained models from the path.
   - `--repl`: Enter interactive mode.

   This will enter an IPython interactive environment where you can play with the model. The most useful method here
   is `sample`, which will allow you to perform sampling-based decoding on the model given a topic entity from the
   dataset. The accepted arguments are:

   - `name`: The name of the topic entity, e.g. `name="Barack Obama"`.
   - `split` and `index`: The index of the topic entity, e.g. `split='test', index=1` gives the first entity from the
     test set.
   - `max_length`: Maximum number of words to generate.
   - `n_tries`: Run sampling for multiple trials, and output the generated result with the highest probability.
   - For other options, please see the method signature for `models.lrlm.LRLM.sampling_decode()`.

   For other methods that you can use, please refer to the `repl.py` file.

   Here's a demo output of running inference:
   ```
   > ./scripts/train_lrlm_wikitext_short.sh --repl --pretrained lrlm-transformer-wikitext-short/
   Random seed set to 4731
   lrlm-wikitext-short
   Loaded model weights from lrlm-wikitext-short/model31.pt
   Execute `sample(name="Barack Obama")` to generate samples for given entity.
   Execute `sample(split='test', index=1)` to generate samples for specific data entry.
   For more configurable settings, please refer to method `models.lrlm.LRLM.sampling_decode`.

versions and/or devices might lead to slightly different results. 


## Understanding and Extending the Code

### Creating the Dataset

Please see [this document](docs/data.md) for a detailed description of the dataset format, and instructions for creating
the WikiText dataset from scratch. Similar process can be applied to creating your custom datasets.
